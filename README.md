**Note:ONE INSTALL MUST BE MODDED FOR THIS TO WORK. I might change this in the future if i ever end up wanting to rewrite the whole thing to support multiple installs.

This program is just a really simple way to switch your Omori installs between two if you have one for modded and one for the base game.

I recommened keeping the program in a folder since it creates a text file to store your steam location

Usage: 
1. Run the program
2. Enter your steam game install location (Ex. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common)
3. If your game is modded, enter y, if not, enter N
4. Do whatever the script says from there depending on what you inputted

All the usage steps are already put in the program, but they're also here incase you need them
